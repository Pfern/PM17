<b>F&aacute;tima Al-Shahrour</b> obtained her PhD from Universidad Aut&oacute;noma de Madrid (UAM) in 2006. During her PhD she worked at the Bioinformatics Unit 
at Spanish National Cancer Research Center (CNIO, Madrid, Spain) and Centro de Investigaciones Pr&iacute;ncipe Valencia (Valencia, Spain). During this period, 
her research work dealt with the development of new Bioinformatics tools for microarray gene expression analysis, with a particular focus on computational 
methods for the functional interpretation of high-throughput experiments. In 2007, she joined the Computational Biology and Bioinformatics group at Cancer 
Program at Broad Institute of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Harvard (Cambridge, USA). In 2008, she got a staff position at Broad Institute 
of MIT and Harvard as a Computational Biologist. During this period, her research was focused on the study the biology and treatment of cancer under a genomic 
perspective using hematopoiesis as a model system. In 2012 she joined the Spanish National Cancer Research Centre (CNIO) to lead the Translational Bioinformatics Unit (TBU) 
in the Clinical Research Programme and since 2017 she is leading the Bioinformatics Unit (BU).<br>
The CNIO Bioinformatics Unit (BU) belongs to the Structural and Biocomputing Programme. This is a group with a large trajectory in bioinformatics for functional genomics, 
field in which the group has published numerous papers as well as developed distinct applications and programs widely used by the scientific community.
BU's major research activity is focused on the development of new computational methodologies to perform genomic analysis of cancer patients' data, in order to identify 
new biomarkers and mechanisms of drug response. The main goal is to translate this knowledge into effective treatments for cancer patients. Since 2013, we extensively 
collaborate with hospitals to analyze next-generation sequencing data from patient's tumors. During this period, we have applied our analytical pipeline for the categorization 
and interpretation of patient's tumors and match them to effective drugs or treatments based on their genomic alterations.

<h1>Course Description</h1>
The implementation of cancer genomics into the clinic is becoming a reality. Personalized medicine or Precision medicine as other authors refers, uses molecular data of a 
specific patient to guide clinical decisions such as prevention, diagnosis and treatment. This will revolutionize healthcare and will play a dominant role in the future of 
cancer therapy. Bioinformatics analyses are essential to identify patients who will benefit from treatment based on their molecular profile, and to tailor chemotherapeutic 
regimens accordingly.<br>
The aim of the course is to present a complete computational pipeline for the analysis and interpretation of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data such as exome sequencing or 
targeted panels that are commonly used in the clinic.<br>
We will address the implementation of large-scale genomic sequencing in clinical practice and the recently developed computational strategies for the analysis of NGS data with 
a particular emphasis on the interpretation of the results, selection of biomarkers of drug response and afford opportunities to match therapies with the characteristics of the 
individual patient's tumour. <br>
Exercises and case studies focused on cancer will be used to illustrate the principles of how genetics influence led to refining diagnoses and personalized treatment of cancer 
disease.<br>

<h1>Target audience</h1>
This course is intended for working healthcare professionals and Bioinformaticians working in the area.

<h1>Pre-requisites</h1>
The course assumes that attendees are not intimidated by the prospect of gaining experience working on UNIX-like operating systems (including the shell, and shell scripting). 
Attendees should understand some of the science behind high-throughput DNA sequencing and sequence analysis, as we will not go deeply into underlying theory (or the mechanics of 
given algorithms, for example) as such. What will be taught are technical solutions for automating and sharing such analyses in reusable compute environments, which 
will include (but is not limited to) beginner-level programming, and basic Linux provisioning. General computer literacy, (e.g. editing plain text data files, navigating using the 
command line) will be assumed. (*)
<br><br>
<b>(*) Note:</b> An optional free session will be arranged with the participants that may be interested, on the EVE of the first day (Monday, Sept 26th at 4PM), where we will 
ensure that every participant willing to attend can use the Linux operating system at the required level.<br>
